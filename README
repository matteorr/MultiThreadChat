 * To execute program please use following instruction in the correct order: 
 * - $> ./chatserverTCP 'IP' ['port']
 *
 * - $> ./chatclientTCP 'wanted client host name' 'IP'
 *  ...
 * - $> ./chatclientTCP 'wanted client host name' 'IP'
 *
 * Execution will result in the setup of a single multithread server managing a number of clients who will be able to send messages and status requests between them
 * 'IP' and 'port' should be the ip address and port on which the server is listening for incoming clients. Each client should specify its client name and the server to which connect
